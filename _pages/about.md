I am a 5th year PhD Candidate in applied mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, advised by [Georg Stadler](https://math.nyu.edu/~stadler/). My research focuses on uncertainty quantification, particularly Bayesian inverse problems that arise from PDE-governed systems. These are parameter estimation problems that are often infinite-dimensional, so much of my research is aimed at deriving methods that are computationally feasible even in very high dimensions. 

Most recently, I have been working on developing scalable methods of marginalizing out the effects of unknown hyperparameters on PDE-governed Bayesian inverse problems. This work will be on the arxiv in Spring 2026. 

The first four years of my PhD were supported by the Department of Energy's [Computational Sciences Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/). Prior to that, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics with Computer Science at MIT. I expect to finish my PhD in Spring 2027, and I will be on the academic job market this fall.
